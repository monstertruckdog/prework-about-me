      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>A couple of things about me:  well, for starters I'm the type of person who--whoa, whoa, wait, hold on.  Where's my phone?</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Raleigh, North Carolina, but I hardly see how that's relevant right now since I'm missing my phone.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Using my phone to take pictures, call people, look at emails, but unfortunately I can't do any of that because my phone is lost.  Could you help me find it?</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>In the context of someone who's desparately searching for something they've lost, it's a little strange to be asking big questions like "What's your dream job?"  Right now, I can't even find my phone, so I'm not entirely conrident I can answer a question like that.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In Wake County, NC.  Why?  Are you coming to help me search for my phone?</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Not neccessarily be a web developer per say, but have the skills that a developer has and apply those skills to my current job, or similar job,or even find something tangental like technical writing, or product ownership.  Now, can we go back to places where my phone might be?  Do you think I left it in my jacket?</p>
